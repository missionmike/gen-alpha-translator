This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies locally with `npm i`

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Translation Definitions

The translation definitions can be found in `components/Translator/translations.ts`

## Plans

Maybe get an OpenAI API key and have ChatGPT give the translation a final pass for grammatical niceness.

## Contribute
